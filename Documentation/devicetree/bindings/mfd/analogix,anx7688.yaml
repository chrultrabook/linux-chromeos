title: Analogix ANX7688 HDMI to USB Type-C Bridge (Port Controller with MUX)

description: |
  ANX7688 converts HDMI 2.0 to DisplayPort 1.3 Ultra-HDi (4096x2160p60)
  including an intelligent crosspoint switch to support USB Type-C (USB-C).
  The integrated crosspoint switch supports USB 3.1 data transfer along with
  the DisplayPort Alternate Mode signaling over USB Type-C. Additionally,
  an on-chip microcontroller (OCM) is available to manage the signal switching,
  Channel Configuration (CC) detection, USB Power Delivery (USB-PD), Vendor
  Defined Message (VDM) protocol support and other functions as defined in the
  USB TypeC and USB Power Delivery specifications.

  As a result, a multi-function device is exposed as parent of the video
  bridge, TCPC and MUX blocks.
